
1) SF2 is capable of playing two samples in the same time. Orba2 is not.
    In case if samples share the same key and velocity ranges, they can be mixed together with pydub.
    (for stero pair samples, left and right. for example)
    
    If ranges overlap, it is just impossible to express sf2 instrument in Orba2 terms.

2) SF2 is capable of assigning sample to the range, and Orba2 is capable too for Lead/Chord/Bass.
    However Orba2 in Drums mode  sample mapping assigns only one note per sample group explicitly.
    It means that for supporting Drum mode noteThreshold key ranges should be split to one-note ranges.
    And sample groups should be duplicated multiple time to match that amount of ranges.
    Each note would require it's own SampleDrumPatch record.

3) Too many SampleDrumPatches breaks Orba2
4) Too long velocity threshold groups break orba as well
